# FetchImage 0.x

## FetchImage 0.4.0

*Mar 03, 2021*

- **Internal Change** `ImageRequest` objects are now optional and may not be immediately fulfilled when initializing a `FetchImage` instance. This allows expansion of the API for additional changes and improvements.
- Google Firebase support. Using the new convenience initializer to create a `FetchImage` instance with a Firestore `StorageReference` instead of directly from a URL. Optionally, supply any cached URL content when using this initializer to decrease Firestore roundtrips.
- Fixed and expanded in-line documentation.

## FetchImage 0.3.0

*Dec 26, 2020*

- **Breaking Change** `FetchImage` no longer starts the request in the initializer, you must call `fetch()`.
- Add `reset()` method which clears the entire `FetchImage` state including the downloaded image. This is crucial for long lists where you don't want `FetchImage` instances to retain images which are off screen.
